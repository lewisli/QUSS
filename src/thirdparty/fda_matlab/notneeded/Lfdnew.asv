function Lfdobj = Lfd(m, n, wfdcell, afdcell, ufdcell)
%  LFD creates a linear differential operator object of the form
%
%  Lx(t) = w_0(t) x(t) + w_1(t) Dx(t) + ... 
%          w_{m-1}(t) D^{m-1}x(t) + D^m x(t) + ...
%          a_1(t) u_1(t)  + ... + a_k(t) u_k(t).
%  
%  Function x(t) is operated on by this operator L, and the operator
%  computes a linear combination of the function and its first m
%  derivatives.  The function x(t) may be vector-valued.  This part
%  part of the operator (the first two lines in the above equation)
%  is called the HOMOGENEOUS part of the operator.
%
%  The linear combination of derivatives is defined by the weight 
%  or coefficient functions w_j(t), and these are assumed to vary  
%  over t, although of course they may also be constant as a 
%  special case.  
%
%  If x(t) is vector valued containing n scalar functions x_i(t), 
%  there will be weight functions not only for each derivative, 
%  but also for each function within any specific function.  
%  In effect, weight function w_j(t) will be an n by n matrix-valued 
%  function providing a weighting of the jth derivative of each 
%  function x_i(t) specific to each function x_i(t).
%  In this event, the functions w(t) are organized into a 
%  three-dimensional array with dimensions n, n, and m.
%
%  The operator $L$ is potentially defined by one or more known
%  scalar forcing functions u_1(t), ..., u_k(t), each multiplied by  
%  a weight or coefficient function a(t).  If the forcing functions
%  are defined, then the operator is called NONHOMOGENEOUS, and the
%  nonhomogenous part of the operator is the third lined in the 
%  above equation.
%  If x(t)$ is vector-valued, then so are their weight functions,
%  and the collection of weight functions is organized into an
%  n by k matrix.
%
%  It may be required that within any of these three groups the 
%  functions will vary in complexity.  Consequently, each group
%  is input to constructor function Lfd() as a cell object, and
%  each individual function within the group is defined within
%  a cell member.
%  
%  The evaluation of the linear differential operator L is applied to 
%  basis functions takes place in function EVAL_BASIS().  

%  The evaluation of the linear differential oHere
%  the entire operator is applied, including any forcing functions
%  defined in UFDCELL and weighted by AFDCELL.
%
%  The inner products of the linear differential operator L 
%  applied to basis functions is evaluated in function
%  GETBASISPENALTY().  Here only the homogeneous part of the operator 
%  is used, defined in WFDCELL.
%
%  Some important functions also have the capability of allowing
%  the argument that is an LFD object be an integer. They convert 
%  the integer internally to an LFD object by INT2LFD().  These are:
%     EVAL_FD()
%     EVAL_MON()
%     EVAL_POS()
%     EVAL_BASIS()
%     GETBASISPENALTY()
%
%  Arguments:
%
%  M       ... the order of the operator, NDERIV, that is,
%          the highest order of derivative.
%  N       ... the length of the vector of functions x(t).
%          Strictly speaking, these first two arguments could
%          be eliminated, but they serve the purpose of 
%          permitting the checking of the dimensions of the 
%          next three cell objects.
%  WFDCELL ... A cell vector object with m cells if x(t) is a scalar 
%          function,
%          or a cell array object with dimensions n, n, and m if
%          x(t) is an n-vector valued function.
%  AFDCELL ... A cell vector object with k cells if x(t) is scalar,
%          where k is the number of forcing functions.  
%          If x(t) is n-vector valued, then AFDCELL will be a cell
%          matrix object with n rows and k columns.
%          k may be zero, in which case AFDCELL will be an empty cell,
%          and this is the default if AFDCELL is not supplied.
%  UFDCELL ... A cell vector containing the forcing functions.
%          If UFDCELL is not supplied but AFDCELL is, then the 
%          default is the unit function using the constant basis.
%
%  Simple cases: 
%
%  All this generality may not be needed, and, for example, 
%  often the linear differential operator will be 
%  simply L = D^m, defining Lx(t) = D^mx(t).  Or the weights and 
%  forcing functions may all have the same bases, in which case 
%  it is simpler to use a functional data objects to define them.  
%  These situations cannot be accommodated within Lfd(), but
%  there is function int2Lfd(m) that converts a nonnegative 
%  integer m into an Lfd object equivalent to D^m. 
%  There is also fd2cell(fdobj) and that converts a functional 
%  data object into cell object, which can then be used as
%  an argument of Lfd().
%
%  Returns:
%
%  LFDOBJ ... a functional data object
